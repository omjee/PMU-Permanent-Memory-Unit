# ABSTRACT
Read only memory like firmware for computer. Basic computer components should have CPU, GPU, RAM, ROM, BIOS (hardware firmware) and PMU (software firmware).

# Keywords
Data Centers, Computer Design, Performance, Energy Saving, AI, Memory Management.

# INTRODUCTION
Think of dictionary for possible units for 5 basic senses Vision (Photos, Videos), Hearing (Audio), Touch (Pressure, Texture, Speed), Taste (Chemical Sensors), Smell (Chemical Sensors), later two are complicated but first 3 are already in place.  Let’s understand the problem first to understand Permanent Memory Unit-(PMU).

# STORY
**AI** (Artificial Intelligence) still trying to mimic how human thinks based on data provided and trying to solve that problem for bigger in numbers and larger in scale and faster in time to beat Human. 

### Computer has problems:
**CPU**	—A central processing Unit that handles most of the mathematic problem
**RAM**	—A Temporary storage for read and write to shuffle and load fast.
**ROM**	—Actual Storage of Data 
“All these still doing as human do, we make papers, makes copies, distribute and again make copies, and it never stops”. 

**Because of that single problem, we probably have our same marriage photos sitting on facebook, tape, hard drives, pen drives and couple of CDs/DVDs.  We did not solve the problem. **

To solve that problems, we buy more hard drives, creates more backups and now we have billions of dollar industries to just manage those data called data centers, they have invested heavily on how to manage electricity and save energy bills and make super-fast networks. 
Science talk

Claiming no knowledge of previously existed data or method to do same, since I have not used it or aware of it with my google search I am assuming its hidden somewhere in copies or not there.

* Lets say PMU is City with 5 towns one for each sense, and every individual unite of sense gets house with address.  
Anyone goes to address asks for whats in there it returns its value. *

So with that example:

**I have my selfie taken in black and white ,  it has only two possible value black or white, PMU knows which one is black and which one white, my selfie image knows whats address of white and black.  When I save my photo in computer I only store the arrangement of black and white as image. **

I am not PHD holder in memory management or storage but that can give you effiency of 900%, in both transfer and storage, 900% more or higher on CPU.

By doing so, 10MBps 3G speed will beat 100MBps LTE, and 16GB phone will beat 128GB. 

# ARCHITECTURE/DESIGN: --Talk to me 

### What I need from other Developers
#### Code Any Language---
  1. Bitmap image util that converts color pixel byte array address to bitmap image--highest bit possibble but minimum 16 bit RGB.
  2. String Utils that converts Unicode Charactor Byte Array address to String Char.
  3. Sound Utils that takes address of wave nodes/sound (Frequency) with variable ammplitude...gates and filter will be later
  4. Touch/Smell/Taste later.
  
  
  
# Conclusion

1000% in total saving for Networking, storage and energy, PMU can put down part cast by 1000%.
